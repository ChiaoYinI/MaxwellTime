# MaxwellTime

Forward modelling and sensitivities for quasi-static, non-dispersive time domain electromagnetics. Grounded and inductive sources are allowed. Sources provided by discretized wire path passed to getEdgeIntegralOfPolygonalChain.

# Installation

From the julia prompt run
```
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/MaxwellUBC/MaxwellTime.git")
```

# Tests

(Thorough testing of sensitivities available in test directory. Should move get data tests here.)
